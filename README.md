# Python
I've learnt Python during the covid outbreak. To give an idea of my capabilities I've solved the challenges presented at https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-code-challenges/find-prime-factors. \
The most interesting challenges are Find all list items (uses a recursive function) and the Soduku solver.
